# StackExchange Solutions Repository

This repository contains code that I use to answer questions on (mostly) Cross Validated (https://stats.stackexchange.com/) Stack Overflow (https://stackoverflow.com/), https://datascience.stackexchange.com/ and occaisionally https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/ . It includes various Python and R scripts and data files associated with topics in statistics, data analysis, and statistical modeling. Given the nature of this work - ansawering questions in my spare time - please do not expect to find production-quality code here.

For anyone intereted, here are my active StackExchange profiles:

## Contents of this Repository

- **Scripts**: Each script file is (usually) titled by question ID or descriptive keywords related to the topic addressed, such as mixed-effects models, GLMMs, ANCOVA, and more. Each script is (usuallu) dedicated to a particular question - ie., there should not be more than one question addressed in each script.
- **Data**: Contains sample data or structured data frames used within specific scripts for testing or demonstrating statistical techniques. Mostly these will be simulated datasets.

## Structure

The repository is just structured by individual `R` scripts that each address unique questions or analyses. I tend to be quite judicious in my use of comments in scripts - I try to write self-documenting code as much as possible.

### Notable Topics

- **Mixed-Effects Models**: Examples of linear and generalised linear mixed-effects models, dealing with both nested and crossed random effects. I am currently ranked Number 1 over all time on the `[mixed-model` tag:
  https://stats.stackexchange.com/tags/mixed-model/topusers
  
- **Statistical Tests**: Scripts demonstrate various statistical tests (eg., t-tests, ANOVA, ANCOVA) under different conditions. I am currently ranked Number 9 on the `[Regression]` tag:
  https://stats.stackexchange.com/tags/regression/topusers
  
- **Data Imputation**: Examples of handling missing data, including parametric bootstrap and other imputation techniques. I am currently ranked Number 1 on the `[Missing-Data]` tag:
  
- **Casual Inference / Causality**: Examples of commmon and non-so-common issues in causal inference and causality. I am currently ranked Number 4 over all time on the `[Causality]'
  
- **Model Diagnostics**: Scripts include diagnostic steps for model validation, assumptions checking, and interpretation.

- `R` Programming: I am currently ranked Number 1 over all time on the `[R]` tag:
  https://stats.stackexchange.com/tags/mixed-model/topusers
- `Python` programming: I am currently ranked Number 6 ovger all time on the `[Pytyhon]` tag:
  https://stats.stackexchange.com/tags/python/topusers


## How to Use

1. Clone the repository: 
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/WRobertLong/Stackexchange.git
   ```
   
2. Open and explore the R scripts to review different statistical methods applied to real-world questions.
3. Each script is self-contained, making it easy to isolate and run specific analyses or models.
